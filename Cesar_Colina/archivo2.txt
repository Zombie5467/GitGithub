en mi camino a full stack, alguna de las cosas mas grandes, comenzaron pequeñas, paso a paso.

=============================

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe

Carly Rae Jepsen
