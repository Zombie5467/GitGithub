en mi camino a full stack, alguna de las cosas mas grandes, comenzaron peque√±as, paso a paso.

=============================

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me, maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me, maybe

=============================

Mother there's a side to me you don't know
Different to the child with the smile in your photo,
Made some decisions some wrong some right, now strangers call my number
When I'm sleeping at night
But they're sinners too
And they'll only make me worse.
Don't let me go
And roll away like a penny down a hole in the road

Kings of the City
